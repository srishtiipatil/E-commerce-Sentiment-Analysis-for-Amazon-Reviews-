# E-commerce-Sentiment-Analysis-for-Amazon-Reviews-


üìå **Introduction** <br>
With the growing reliance on e-commerce platforms, customer feedback plays a crucial role in influencing purchasing decisions. This project aims to analyze and predict customer sentiment based on product reviews for Amazon-branded products like Kindle, Fire TV Stick, and more. The dataset contains over 34,000 consumer reviews, with attributes such as brand, categories, review text, and sentiment labels (Positive, Negative, Neutral).

Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, this project builds a model to classify sentiment for unseen product reviews, helping businesses gain valuable insights into customer satisfaction and product performance.


üéØ **Objectives** <br>
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand trends in customer reviews.
Apply text preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
Build machine learning models (e.g., Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, LSTM) to classify sentiment.
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Develop an interactive dashboard for sentiment visualization.


üõ†Ô∏è **Tech Stack** <br>
Programming Languages: Python <br>
Libraries: NLTK, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn


üìä **Outcomes** <br>
A trained sentiment classification model for customer reviews.
Insights into the most common positive and negative keywords.
